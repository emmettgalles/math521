# MATH 521 (Analysis I)

This repository is designed to house information related to the MATH 521 course at UW-Madison. This is an active repository, so changes will be made to the files on a somewhat frequent basis. I will post information about the files below, so please reference this markdown first if an issue or concern arises.

I welcome feedback, questions, or comments you may have about any file in this repository or about the repository as a whole. Please feel free to reach out at egalles@wisc.edu. 

### MATH_521__course_notes.pdf

  - Description: document containing formatted lecture notes from the Spring 2020 semester
  - To-do: create an intro page that goes over common notation or background information that is used in the document but not explicitly defined, find a more cohesive format that doesn't include lecture dates (thinking about grouping by subject similar to chapters in a book)
  - Issues: none (that I'm aware of)
  - General notes: I have already spotted some errors or typos and am in the process of reviewing each definition, theorem, lemma, and so on. If you spot any errors, please let me know!
